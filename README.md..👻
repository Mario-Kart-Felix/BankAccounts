Google Pay may be preloaded on select devices. If your device does not have the app, simply download it from Google Play.

Google Pay requires that you sign-into your Google account before you register any credit/debit cards.

For select devices running Android Marshmallow 6.0 or later, you may use your fingerprint to verify transactions.

How do I add my STAR cards to Google Pay?
Choose the Google Pay icon, and log in using your Google account information. If you do not already have a Google account, you can create one. Once logged in you can, touch ADD CARD in the Google Pay app to begin the process of adding your card. Center the card in the on-screen window and Google Pay will read the card number. Or you can enter the card number manually. Verify or enter the additional information such as Cardholder Name, Expiration Date and Security Code (CVV).

Why am I being asked by STAR to verify my card?

How do I pay using Google Pay?
Once your eligible STAR card is registered to Google Pay, you may select Google Pay as your default wallet. Settings vary by device manufacturer and model, so if you need help setting Google Pay as the default option for making mobile payments, please contact your mobile service provider. Once Google Pay is the default wallet, paying is as simple as unlocking your device and holding the device up to the NFC contactless reader at the point-of-sale. Ensure that your STAR card is set to the default card.

Google Pay will indicate that you are ready to make a payment.
